STEP-BY-STEP COMMANDS TO RUN AFTER CREATING GITHUB REPOSITORY
================================================================

1. FIRST - Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username in the URL below
2. THEN - Run these commands ONE BY ONE in your terminal:

Command 1: Add GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/enhanced-alternate-credit-system.git

Command 2: Push your code to GitHub
git push -u origin main

That's it! Your enhanced alternate credit system will be uploaded to GitHub.

EXAMPLE:
If your GitHub username is "johnsmith", then Command 1 becomes:
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/enhanced-alternate-credit-system.git

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If you get authentication error, GitHub may ask for your username and password
- For newer GitHub accounts, you might need a Personal Access Token instead of password
- If you get "repository not found" error, double-check the URL and your username

WHAT HAPPENS AFTER UPLOAD:
- All 24 files will be uploaded to GitHub
- Your commit message will show all the enhancements made
- Others can see your enhanced credit scoring system
- You can share the repository URL with anyone
